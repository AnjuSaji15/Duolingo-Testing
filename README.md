Aim  
The aim of this project is to ensure the functionality, usability, and performance of the Duolingo 
website through comprehensive manual and automated testing. The manual testing phase focuses on 
performing exploratory testing to identify user experience issues, functionality problems, and 
inconsistencies in design, while also validating the accuracy of language lessons, translations, and 
content. Additionally, it ensures compatibility across various browsers and devices. The automated 
testing phase involves designing and implementing test scripts to continuously validate critical features 
of the website, conducting regression testing to ensure new updates don’t break existing functionalities, 
and assessing performance and load handling under different usage scenarios. Both testing methods 
together aim to provide a thorough evaluation of the website’s quality, ensuring it meets high standards 
of reliability, security, and user experience. 
2. Objective  
The objective of this project is to ensure the Duolingo website’s functionality, usability, and 
performance through both manual and automated testing. The manual testing phase aims to identify 
issues related to user interface design, functionality, and usability while verifying the proper 
functioning of interactive elements such as buttons, links, and forms. It also focuses on validating the 
accuracy and consistency of language lessons, quizzes, translations, and overall content, in addition to 
testing the website’s compatibility across different browsers and devices. The automated testing phase 
focuses on developing test scripts to continuously validate critical features, perform regression testing 
to ensure updates do not break existing functionality, assess the website’s performance under various 
load scenarios, and verify that security features such as user authentication and data privacy are 
functioning correctly. Overall, the project seeks to ensure that Duolingo provides a reliable, secure, 
and user-friendly experience for its users. 
3. TOOLS and TECHNOLOGY USED

ii. 
Manual Testing Tools: 
Web Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari): 
• Purpose: Web browsers are used for manually navigating the Duolingo website to 
check for any usability issues, design inconsistencies, and functionality problems. 
Testers interact directly with the website, testing forms, buttons, links, quizzes, and 
overall content. 
• Explanation: Manual testing in browsers allows testers to simulate user behavior and 
assess the user experience across different platforms. It's a critical tool for checking 
responsiveness and usability, ensuring the website behaves as expected on various 
browsers and devices. 
Automated Testing Tools: 
Selenium: 
• Purpose: Selenium is an open-source tool used for automating web browsers. It allows 
testers to write scripts in various programming languages (like Java, Python, and C#) 
to interact with web pages and test their functionality. 
• Explanation: In this project, Selenium WebDriver is used to automate the testing 
process by simulating user actions on the Duolingo website. This includes interacting 
with forms, clicking buttons, and verifying elements on the page. Selenium scripts can 
be run repeatedly to ensure that the website behaves correctly after each update or 
change. It's particularly useful for regression testing, where automated scripts can 
quickly check if new code changes have affected existing functionality. Selenium helps 
speed up the testing process, increases accuracy, and allows for continuous testing in a 
CI/CD pipeline. 
4. METHODOLOGY USED 
The methodology used in this project for testing the Duolingo website involves a combination of 
Manual Testing and Automated Testing, with a focus on ensuring the website's functionality, 
usability, performance, and security. 
1. Manual Testing Methodology: 
• Exploratory Testing: Testers will explore the Duolingo website by manually 
interacting with it, identifying defects and issues in real-time. This includes verifying 
features such as quizzes, buttons, forms, and translations. 
• Functional Testing: Testers will check that all functional elements of the website work 
as intended, including user login, registration, lesson navigation, and interaction with 
quizzes. 
• Usability Testing: Assessing the user interface (UI) and overall user experience (UX) 
to ensure the website is intuitive, easy to use, and visually appealing across different 
browsers and devices. 
• Compatibility Testing: The website will be tested on various web browsers (Chrome, 
Firefox, Edge, Safari) and devices (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure consistent 
performance and appearance. 
• Regression Testing: After any new update or feature is added, manual testers will check 
whether the changes have affected existing functionalities. 
2. Automated Testing Methodology: 
• Selenium WebDriver: Automated tests will be written using Selenium to simulate user 
actions such as clicking, typing, and navigating through the website. These scripts will 
ensure that critical features work consistently after each release. 
• Test Case Automation: Based on functional requirements, specific test cases (e.g., 
login functionality, navigation, language lessons) will be automated to save time and 
resources. Test scripts will run automatically at regular intervals or during new 
deployments. 
• Regression Testing: Automated Selenium scripts will perform regression testing to 
confirm that new updates do not break previously working features. These tests will be 
executed every time code is updated to ensure ongoing quality. 
• Performance Testing: Selenium will also be used for performance testing by 
simulating high user traffic and checking how the Duolingo website handles the load, 
response times, and resource usage. 
• Continuous Integration (CI): The automated tests will be integrated into a CI pipeline 
(e.g., using Jenkins), ensuring that tests are run automatically whenever code changes 
are made. This helps maintain the stability and quality of the website throughout 
development. 
      
By combining manual testing to identify real-world user issues and exploratory defects, with 
automated testing using Selenium for efficiency and regression, the methodology ensures thorough 
and continuous evaluation of the Duolingo website's functionality and performance.
